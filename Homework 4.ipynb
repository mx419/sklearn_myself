    "In this HW we are trying to find the best linear model to predict if a record represents the Higgs Boson. One of the drivers of the performance of a model is the sample size of the training set.  As a data scientist, sometimes you have to decide if you have enough data or if you should invest in more.  We can use learning curve analysis to determine if we have reached a performance plateau. This will inform us on whether or not we should invest in more data (in this case it would be by running more experiments).\n",

    "\n",
    "Because of the inherent randomness of subsamples of size $N_i$, we should expect that any single sample of size $N_i$ might not be representative of an algorithm’s performance at a given training set size. To quantify this variance and get a better generalization, we will also use bootstrap analysis. In bootstrap analysis, we pull multiple samples of size $N_i$, build a model, evaluate on a test set, and then take an average and standard error of the results.\n",
